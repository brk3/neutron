    Enabled the usage of MySQL Cluster (NDB) with Neutron. This includes the
    usage of the boolean mysql_enable_ndb setting from oslo.db 4.24 and
    above. This feature allows operators to select from MySQL (InnoDB) or
    MySQL Cluster (NDB) as the database storage engine backend. This feature
    is intended only for new installations as there is no automated migration
    path from InnoDB to MySQL Cluster (NDB).
